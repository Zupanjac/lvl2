## Overview

The game tournament will use the Swiss system for pairing up players in each round: 
players are not eliminated, and each player should be paired with another player
 with the same number of wins, or as close as possible.

This project has two parts: defining the database schema (SQL table definitions), 
and writing the code that will use it.
